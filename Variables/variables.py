Python Variables:
This entry details how to utilize variables.
Variables are, in their most basic form, placeholders for values. In Python, initializing variables is made simple.  
By assigning a value to a variable, a named reference is created that can be used to retrieve and modify the associated data.

# Initializing Variables 
number = 10 #int
name = "name" #string
float = 4.3 #float
is_alive = False #bool

# Assigning multiple values in one line.
a, b, c, d = (1, 2.5, 4, 5)

# Printing values. 
print(a, b, c, d)

# Performing basic arithmetic. 
a = a + 3 # Addition
b = b * 3 # Multiplication
c = c / 2 # Division
d = d - 4 # Subtraction

# Printing values. 
print(a, b, c, d)
