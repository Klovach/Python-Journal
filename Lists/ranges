Ranges:
A range is a sequence of numbers. The range function is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
By default, a range starts from 0, increments by 1 and stops before the number that is specified.
In the example below, the range function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9.
Like arrays, the counting starts at 0.

'''
One Argument:
Generate a list of integers and output the result as a list. 
'''
numbers = list(range(10))
print(numbers)

'''
Two Arguments:
If a range is called with one argument, it produces a sequence of numbers from 0 to that number.
If, however, the range is called with two arguments it produces a sequence of numbers from the first number to the second number.
The following code will output a sequence of numbers from 5 to 9.
'''
numbers = list(range(5, 10))
print(numbers)

'''
# Three Arguments 
# If a range is called with three arguments, it produces a sequence of numbers from the first number to the second number.
# The third argument is the step. The step is the amount by which the sequence is incremented. 
'''
numbers = list(range(2, 20, 2))
print(numbers)

'''
Going Backwards:
By default, the range function increments by 1. However, the step can be negative.
This will output the numbers 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
numbers = list(range(10, 0, -1))
